40
00:01:57,210 -> 00:02:00,070

You need a Atest by their doctor
confirms that it is necessary.

50
00:02:22,070 -> 00:02:24,050
Oh, that's stupid.

51

Was replaced.

54
00:02:29,630 -> 00:02:30,620
It can not do it!

55
00:02:30,630 -> 00:02:32,420
This is the only KFC
in all of South Park

56
00:02:32,430 -> 00:02:33,970
Yeah, well, I need a doctor.

57
00:02:33,980 -> 00:02:35,490
To the doctor? But Dad, we just want to eat.

58
00:02:35,500 -> 00:02:37,750
I must go to the doctor.

59
00:02:41,090 -> 00:02:43,310
So no KFC?

60
00:02:43,320 -> 00:02:44,860
This is a nightmare.

61
00:02:44,870 -> 00:02:48,340
This is a nightmare and I can not wake up!

62
00:02:50,100 -> 00:02:53,170
Well, Mr. Marsh, it seems
are in good health.

63
00:02:53,180 -> 00:02:55,940
Her blood picture was excellent and
All her vital organs are normal.

64
00:02:55,960 -> 00:02:57,430
Alll clear!

65
00:02:57,440 -> 00:02:59,100
Yup, you are healthy.

66
00:02:59,110 -> 00:02:59,930
That's great.

67
00:02:59,940 -> 00:03:01,890
So I can get a recommendation from them?

68
00:03:01,900 -> 00:03:02,970
For what?

69
00:03:02,990 -> 00:03:05,270
Medical marijuana.

70
00:03:05,280 -> 00:03:07,120
It has such a shop in
KCF old building open

71
00:03:07,140 -> 00:03:10,170
and I say a medical recommendation needed
to buy marijuana.

72
00:03:10,180 -> 00:03:13,590
Mr.Marsh, they are not
Qualified medical marijuana.

73
00:03:13,600 -> 00:03:15,180
But they said but I'm in health!

74
00:03:15,190 -> 00:03:18,500
Medical marijuana is for
People who are not so healthy!

75
00:03:18,510 -> 00:03:20,510
AIDS patients, cancer patients.

76
00:03:20,520 -> 00:03:22,710
You know, people get chemo?

77
00:03:22,720 -> 00:03:25,280
The THC helps to eat something
and relieves the pain.

78
00:03:25,290 -> 00:03:28,490
They are in good shape!

79
00:03:28,780 -> 00:03:31,620
Well, that's shit.

00:03:42,260 -> 00:03:42,990

00:04:03,530 -> 00:04:05,480
I've already waited too long to chicken.

91
00:04:05,490 -> 00:04:06,910
Eric, we are almost in Frisco

92
00:04:06,920 -> 00:04:09,310
Why do not we go there to
ChurchŽs Fried Chicken?

93
00:04:09,320 -> 00:04:10,030

94
00:04:10,040 -> 00:04:12,750

nothing more to it.

00:04:26,820 -> 00:04:28,060
No, it can not do it.

101
00:04:28,080 -> 00:04:29,950
The KFC in my town has closed!

102
00:04:29,960 -> 00:04:35,210
Yeah. Well that's because of the vote last November,
from the fast food shops
low-income areas to banish.

103
00:04:35,220 -> 00:04:37,650
You mean I have to drive to Denver
to get chicken?

104
00:04:37,660 -> 00:04:39,230
No! You do not Raff smaller.

105
00:04:39,240 -> 00:04:42,040
KFCŽs were only in low-income neighborhoods.

106
00:04:42,050 -> 00:04:48,460
In total seed Colorado
Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.

107
00:04:50,480 -> 00:04:52,780
Neeeeiiiiinnnn!

108
00:04:57,990 -> 00:05:01,100

00:05:29,760 -> 00:05:31,510
Oh my God! KFC is the sauce!

119
00:05:31,520 -> 00:05:34,000
They have KFC. Yes!

120
00:05:40,890 -> 00:05:42,340
That's it?

121
00:05:42,360 -> 00:05:44,490

126
00:05:52,150 -> 00:05:53,320

Oh God. It's so good.

129
00:06:01,460 -> 00:06:04,620
Frozen and processed food
seems to be a direct wire

130
00:06:04,630 -> 00:06:07,380
to the stomach and colon cancer to have.

131
00:06:07,390 -> 00:06:08,960
All right.

00:06:12,660 -> 00:06:16,080
Tests show the preservative substances in
The main reasons are eating.

However, fortunately these grow
Cancers slowly and take years to unfold around him.

134
00:06:21,350 -> 00:06:23,240
Damn.

135
00:06:23,250 -> 00:06:25,080
Testicular cancer.

136
00:06:25,090 -> 00:06:28,040
Most common in older men
and can be very aggressive.

137
00:06:28,050 -> 00:06:29,140
Oh that's good.

138
00:06:29,150 -> 00:06:32,450
The data are not what testicular cancer
can erupt quickly.

139
00:06:32,460 -> 00:06:36,140
Whatever the Hautpursache for
Testicular cancer are at

182
00:09:08,530 -> 00:09:11,460
I'm not!

183
00:09:11,710 -> 00:09:13,210
Wait, wait!

184
00:09:13,220 -> 00:09:14,790
You're a big boy, eric.

185
00:09:14,800 -> 00:09:16,920
Maybe you can pay me back in a different way.

00:09:16,930 -> 00:09:18,290
Kill NEN small job for me.

187
00:09:18,300 -> 00:09:21,330
I still expect something

I need someone with a bit
Risk and agree to pick up.

189
00:09:24,310 -> 00:09:25,540
About how much are we talking about KFC?

190
00:09:25,560 -> 00:09:28,850
Two buckets MenüŽs plus 3 ... 4 Sides (extra menu)

191
00:09:28,860 -> 00:09:30,650
Holy old.

192
00:09:30,660 -> 00:09:33,650
I have the money to pay it, but
Risky business is pretty these days.

193
00:09:33,660 -> 00:09:37,570
You get me the chicken for me and I

Whether I want to do it?

196
00:09:41,090 -> 00:09:44,850
Help people to pedophiles

Oh, I got the stuff.

211
00:11:01,100 -> 00:11:04,090
Question is, you have the money?

212
00:11:04,580 -> 00:11:07,210
All right. We're in business.

213
00:11:09,420 -> 00:11:10,540
It's all there.

214
00:11:10,560 -> 00:11:11,610
Extra crispy, right?

215
00:11:11,620 -> 00:11:14,280
ŽTürlich you, I'm a fool!

216
00:11:19,480 -> 00:11:21,600
Are you trying to cheat me, old?

217
00:11:21,610 -> 00:11:24,140
That's sauce mixed with Boston Market!

218
00:11:24,150 -> 00:11:26,400
Aw, it's all the same.

219
00:11:26,420 -> 00:11:28,680
It is not the same!

220
00:11:28,980 -> 00:11:31,050
Okay, okay! I'm sorry, yo!


221
00:11:31,060 -> 00:11:32,790
You mix the sauce with Colonel

223
00:11:34,450 -> 00:11:36,130
I take back the sauce!

224
00:11:36,140 -> 00:11:38,250
As someone who would eat KFC without sauce!

225
00:11:38,260 -> 00:11:40,210
Ahghg! Please, please, I'm sorry!

226

00:11:42,890 -> 00:11:45,410
What's going on back then?

229
00:11:45,420 -> 00:11:48,140
Nothing, everything cool!

Ah man.

233
00:11:53,710 -> 00:11:55,970
This "Rainy Day Woman" is the bomb.

234
00:11:55,980 -> 00:11:58,680
Folks, you do not know what you're missing.

235
00:11:59,060 -> 00:12:02,210
Well, you know you could
some parts of us, Randy.

00:12:02,220 -> 00:12:04,340
No Nelson, which is illegal.

237
00:12:04,350 -> 00:12:06,820
I can not smoke it because I have cancer.

238
00:12:06,840 -> 00:12:09,770
- Ah, come on, give us just a little off!
- Yeah.

239
00:12:09,780 -> 00:12:12,220
Get yourself your own recipe for
Medical Marijuana!

00:12:12,230 -> 00:12:15,390
You all have perfectly functioning
Miro waves at home.

241
00:12:15,440 -> 00:12:17,560
I watch, I'll tell you it's unbelievable.

242
00:12:17,570 -> 00:12:19,130
I have everything I want marijuana.

243
00:12:19,140 -> 00:12:22,690
I'll be changing faster than walking
and whenever I need a seat,

244
00:12:22,700 -> 00:12:24,910
I can sit on my balls.

245
00:12:24,920 -> 00:12:26,940
Let me tell you something.

246
00:12:26,950 -> 00:12:29,850
TussiŽs stand upon.

247
00:12:29,860 -> 00:12:31,640
Women love giant egg?

248
00:12:31,650 -> 00:12:32,970
Love.

249
00:12:32,980 -> 00:12:34,730
Everywhere I go

250
00:12:34,750 -> 00:12:37,620
the TussiŽs turn around and
Waaassss do?

251
00:12:37,630 -> 00:12:42,750
I did not know the women, the eggs
love of men, until I had these guys here.

252
00:12:42,760 -> 00:12:46,200
Travis, do you have the Mü - Wassssss?

253
00:12:46,830 -> 00:12:48,840
You see?

254
00:12:52,490 -> 00:12:54,620
Cartman, my boy! You have what it takes!

255
00:12:54,630 -> 00:12:58,060
Yeah I have the stuff
and I got the money.

256
00:12:58,540 -> 00:13:00,260
Hey, you're good, Eric.

257
00:13:00,270 -> 00:13:01,770
I need people like you.

258
00:13:01,780 -> 00:13:04,820
Good, because I have a bunch
Chicken eaten on the way here forth.

259
00:13:04,830 -> 00:13:06,230
That's okay, Eric.

260
00:13:06,240 -> 00:13:08,070
I got something big planned.

261
00:13:08,080 -> 00:13:12,700
What if I would tell you that I direct NEN
Way have to get everything what we want KFC.

262
00:13:12,710 -> 00:13:14,610
I sent Tommy to KFC

263
00:13:14,620 -> 00:13:18,240
and've got a little agreement
the colonel himself

264
00:13:18,250 -> 00:13:19,110
Wait a minute.

265
00:13:19,120 -> 00:13:20,580
You mean the Colonel?
(Chief of KFC)

266
00:13:20,590 -> 00:13:21,700
That's right.

267
00:13:21,710 -> 00:13:24,310
And I want you to go with Tommy
and strengthen his back.

268
00:13:24,320 -> 00:13:26,750
Is that something that you would do?

269
00:13:26,760 -> 00:13:28,620
Is this something what do I want?

270
00:13:28,630 -> 00:13:29,980
Is the Pope Catholic

271
00:13:29,990 -> 00:13:32,650
and saves her from the world
the pedophiles?

272
00:13:33,060 -> 00:13:35,190
Excellent!.

273
00:13:36,000 -> 00:13:39,610
Doctor, Mister KlineŽs
Test results are back.

274
00:13:40,910 -> 00:13:43,180
What the heck is going on here?

275
00:13:43,190 -> 00:13:44,090
Doctor?

276
00:13:44,100 -> 00:13:46,770
This is the tenth case
I see that week.

277
00:13:46,780 -> 00:13:48,550
This may be a coincidence!

278
00:13:48,560 -> 00:13:53,210
Something in this city are
Men of this city testicular cancer.

279
00:14:03,420 -> 00:14:06,300
Man I'm stoned ass!

280
00:14:06,310 -> 00:14:08,100
I'm Stoned eggs!

281
00:14:08,110 -> 00:14:10,550
Ha ha ha ha

282
00:14:11,790 -> 00:14:15,240
Has anyone yet what
of the "Loompa Loompa" Grass?

283
00:14:17,440 -> 00:14:21,090
Wow, these guys have horny eggs.

284
00:14:21,100 -> 00:14:24,280
I wish my husband would have such things, mmmmm.

285
00:14:25,400 -> 00:14:30,300
Corbin, Kentucky

286
00:14:33,290 -> 00:14:36,630
Our whole production has
Headquartered here, guys.

287
00:14:36,640 -> 00:14:40,110
We deliver over 16 tons
Chicken every month.

288
00:14:40,120 -> 00:14:44,570
Of course, my business has lost
because the new law in Colarado,

289
00:14:44,580 -> 00:14:46,760
and I am concerned that other
States could follow.

290
00:14:46,770 -> 00:14:47,790
This we know, Colonel.

291
00:14:47,800 -> 00:14:49,590
But we can her chicken
schmuckeln in the state.

292
00:14:49,600 -> 00:14:53,180
We just need a reasonable deal.
Let's say $ 4.95 per kilogram?

293
00:14:53,190 -> 00:14:54,380
I must confess, Colonel


294
00:14:54,390 -> 00:14:56,130
They have everything a man
as I could wish.

295
00:14:56,140 -> 00:14:57,470
I like you, Eric.

296
00:14:57,480 -> 00:14:59,070
There's nothing negative at you.

297
00:14:59,080 -> 00:15:02,230
Pathetic way, I do not think
quite as your friend.

298
00:15:02,240 -> 00:15:04,340
Who? You mean Tommy?

299
00:15:05,030 -> 00:15:06,090
Moment! Where did it go?

300
00:15:06,100 -> 00:15:09,680
Your partner is an informant
Jamie Oliver.
(Koch)

301
00:15:19,070 -> 00:15:21,950
Ha ha haaaa!
Age, which was good!

302
00:15:21,960 -> 00:15:23,440
He is fully choked!

303
00:15:23,450 -> 00:15:27,110
How do I know that you're not a liar?

304
00:15:27,140 -> 00:15:28,570
Hey, Colonel!

305
00:15:28,580 -> 00:15:31,200
I'm her biggest supporter
since I am 2 years old.

306
00:15:31,210 -> 00:15:32,110
I love their chicken.

307
00:15:32,120 -> 00:15:33,990
I love you.

308
00:15:34,000 -> 00:15:37,970
I think you and I get
somehow regulated.

309
00:15:37,980 -> 00:15:40,290
Together, long transactions.

310
00:15:40,300 -> 00:15:41,090
Well.

311
00:15:41,100 -> 00:15:45,120
Never forget that, I say it only once,

312
00:15:45,130 -> 00:15:48,000
Fuck with me, Eric

313
00:15:48,570 -> 00:15:51,840
Attempts to never kidding me!

314
00:15:59,350 -> 00:16:00,310
Randy!

315
00:16:00,320 -> 00:16:02,010
Randy, look at some games you

00:16:02,020 -> 00:16:03,750
your eggs are getting bigger!

317
00:16:03,760 -> 00:16:05,480
I know that are quite swollen.

318
00:16:05,490 -> 00:16:08,400
Somehow does hurt, I'll
obtain more marijuana.

319
00:16:08,770 -> 00:16:10,500
Randy, please!

320
00:16:10,510 -> 00:16:14,300
If you come back, think
you think we could make love again?

321
00:16:14,310 -> 00:16:16,730
Oh, because someone has spring fever again?

322
00:16:16,740 -> 00:16:19,310
Oh I just thought a bit more
Time alone, could be really nice

323
00:16:19,320 -> 00:16:22,340
Hey, my eyes are up here.

324
00:16:22,350 -> 00:16:24,060
- Sorry! It is simple.
- It's okay.

325
00:16:24,070 -> 00:16:28,170
I just want what you look at me when
we make love, not just my eggs.

326
00:16:28,180 -> 00:16:30,810
I'll be back soon, babe.

327
00:16:47,000 -> 00:16:52,410
Hey, uh, they might give me half a gram of
give the "Suburban Sunrise" please?

328
00:16:52,420 -> 00:16:56,500
I'm sorry sir, they must
be in the shop

329
00:16:58,080 -> 00:17:00,530
Well, uh, I'm right here. Can
You do not just bring over?

330
00:17:00,540 -> 00:17:06,150
Marijuana outside the boundary of an approved
Sale Laden is still illegal.

331
00:17:11,550 -> 00:17:14,540
#*?##""!

332
00:17:23,330 -> 00:17:25,050
You see, I'll start
I feel a little stupid.

333
00:17:25,060 -> 00:17:27,510
Can I just ask to be high?

334
00:17:28,810 -> 00:17:30,500
What are you crazy Eric?

335
00:17:30,510 -> 00:17:33,490
You have a deal with the Colonel
more than 10,000 boxes?

336
00:17:33,510 -> 00:17:35,310
I can not sell as much chicken!

337
00:17:35,320 -> 00:17:37,800
Calm down Billy, it's all right.

338
00:17:38,180 -> 00:17:39,000
All right!

339
00:17:39,010 -> 00:17:41,060
I make no money here, I lose
money here!

340
00:17:41,070 -> 00:17:42,190
I need to hire more security!

341
00:17:42,200 -> 00:17:44,020
The cops are hanging on my ass

342
00:17:44,030 -> 00:17:46,740
and I must pay all of the sorters
the distribution of the chicken sort!

343
00:17:46,750 -> 00:17:47,520
Billy, Billy.

344
00:17:47,530 -> 00:17:49,180
We need to think bigger.

345
00:17:49,190 -> 00:17:51,800
It's time to expand!

346
00:17:51,920 -> 00:17:56,250
How can I expand when 36%
of our product goes to you?

347
00:17:56,260 -> 00:17:58,890
Go out and buy the chicken
or fuck off!

348
00:17:58,900 -> 00:18:02,300
You've probably forgotten who
the boss of this operation is Eric!

349
00:18:02,310 -> 00:18:03,320
Yeah, and.

350
00:18:03,330 -> 00:18:06,220
You'll no longer long
be here.

351
00:18:06,230 -> 00:18:09,140
What does that mean then?

352
00:18:09,160 -> 00:18:13,470
I'm your mother told you that
one in six had social studies test

353
00:18:13,740 -> 00:18:15,790
That's what you would not.

354
00:18:15,800 -> 00:18:17,540
Makes a bear a lot in the woods?

355
00:18:17,550 -> 00:18:21,250
And the Pope gives a shit about
on the lives and dreams of 200 deaf guys?

356
00:18:21,370 -> 00:18:24,760
Billy! Your father and I
need to talk with you!

357
00:18:24,770 -> 00:18:26,300
Mach's good Billy!

358
00:18:26,310 -> 00:18:27,420
Alright people, listen!

359
00:18:27,430 -> 00:18:28,940
I got the line from now on.

360
00:18:28,950 -> 00:18:31,150
Has anybody a problem with that?

361
00:18:31,160 -> 00:18:32,960
All well clear!

362
00:18:32,970 -> 00:18:34,930
- What do we want?
- Larger doors!

363
00:18:34,950 -> 00:18:37,010
- Where do we want?
- Marijuana shops!

364
00:18:37,020 -> 00:18:38,890
- What do we want?
- Larger doors!

365
00:18:38,900 -> 00:18:41,130
- Where do we want?
- Marijuana shops!

366
00:18:41,140 -> 00:18:46,700
Understand it yet, I can the door of a
already active structure is not enlarge.

367
00:18:46,710 -> 00:18:50,240
Well, I think we could the
Medical Marijuana Act for Change

368
00:18:50,250 -> 00:18:52,640
it can also be sold at the door.

369
00:18:52,650 -> 00:18:53,630
I do not know.

370
00:18:53,640 -> 00:18:57,630
Maybe the rules should be that someone
Another medical marijuana for you concern

371
00:18:57,640 -> 00:19:01,310
Can not we skip all
and make simple marijuana legal?

372
00:19:01,320 -> 00:19:05,460
Each abused the medical system
anyway. It's ridiculous.

373
00:19:05,470 -> 00:19:08,240
What is it ridiculous?

374
00:19:08,770 -> 00:19:10,850
Slowly, slowly people, please!

375
00:19:10,860 -> 00:19:13,860
We all forget what the real
Problem is here!

376
00:19:13,870 -> 00:19:15,050
See them around!

377
00:19:15,060 -> 00:19:17,550
All these men have cancer.

378
00:19:17,560 -> 00:19:22,000
This is no coincidence that as this building
was built, the cancer rate went up.

379
00:19:22,010 -> 00:19:23,230
They do not understand it?

380
00:19:23,240 -> 00:19:27,130
KFC has kept people healthy!

381
00:19:31,250 -> 00:19:32,740
Mr.Cartman come them.

382
00:19:32,750 -> 00:19:34,120
We need to
the business deal.


383
00:19:34,140 -> 00:19:35,840
You are too much of the stuff.

384
00:19:35,850 -> 00:19:39,340
Shut up Kevin. I'm the boss
no you ass-kisser!

385
00:19:39,350 -> 00:19:41,460
Eric! The colonel is
on the phone.

386
00:19:41,470 -> 00:19:42,460
He sounds pretty upset.

387
00:19:42,470 -> 00:19:44,640
What? Oh that's okay, I
forgot about that - Damn!

388
00:19:44,650 -> 00:19:45,680
Okay.

389
00:19:45,690 -> 00:19:47,300
Put him on speaker.

390
00:19:47,310 -> 00:19:48,360
Hello?

391
00:19:48,370 -> 00:19:49,360
Hello?

392
00:19:49,370 -> 00:19:50,690
Colonel, how are you?

393
00:19:50,700 -> 00:19:51,620
What things have happened?

394
00:19:51,630 -> 00:19:54,390
Ohh, we had some
Colonel problem they understand?

395
00:19:54,400 -> 00:19:56,550
Eric, what happened?

396
00:19:56,570 -> 00:19:58,120
We had a little problem.

397
00:19:58,130 -> 00:20:00,500
So I heard.

398
00:20:00,510 -> 00:20:01,950
Yeah, where did you hear that?

399
00:20:01,960 -> 00:20:05,700
Jamie Oliver because his speech
in u.N. Today has held.

400
00:20:05,710 -> 00:20:08,450
It should, however, his speech
not hold, Eric.

401
00:20:08,460 -> 00:20:10,200
Yeah, that's okay. We get it next time.

402
00:20:10,210 -> 00:20:14,520
There is no next time we give you
fucking cocksucker!

403
00:20:14,530 -> 00:20:15,980
Hey, calm Colonel!

404
00:20:15,990 -> 00:20:20,910
I told some time ago,
you fucking little monkey, fuck is wrong with me.

405
00:20:20,920 -> 00:20:24,280
Hey! Hey, what fucking again
who they think they are talking about Colonel?

406
00:20:24,490 -> 00:20:26,400
Oh shit.

407
00:20:32,350 -> 00:20:34,940
It's the cops!

408
00:20:35,420 -> 00:20:37,500
Jimmy racing, racing!

409
00:20:38,420 -> 00:20:41,100
Mami! No!

410
00:20:44,850 -> 00:20:49,930
Last November, this town has one
Law provides that some thought was stupid.

411
00:20:49,940 -> 00:20:54,880
Since the underground black market had
Crime, deaths and shooting.

412
00:20:54,890 -> 00:20:57,210
But now the law was repealed

413
00:20:57,220 -> 00:21:03,020
and I am to announce facilitates
allowed the marijuana illegal again!

414
00:21:04,650 -> 00:21:07,380
And also another law
was abolished

415
00:21:07,390 -> 00:21:11,580
Ever since we lost the KFC
cancer rose rapidly.

416
00:21:11,600 -> 00:21:14,090
But today we can welcome back called the KFC,

417
00:21:14,100 -> 00:21:16,530
and all his medical benefits

418
00:21:19,880 -> 00:21:24,630
Well, I must admit it is much
to come easier with small eggs in a door.

419
00:21:24,640 -> 00:21:26,320
Yeah, great.

420
00:21:26,330 -> 00:21:28,510
Oh Sharon, do not be sad!

421
00:21:28,520 -> 00:21:31,370
The doctor has made you. His souvenir

422
00:21:32,000 -> 00:21:34,250
Oh Randy, I love it!

423
00:21:34,260 -> 00:21:36,400
And when it gets cold, it shrinks.

424
00:21:36,410 -> 00:21:39,010
Sharon, you have a scrotum coat?

425
00:21:39,020 -> 00:21:40,120
Yup!

426
00:21:40,130 -> 00:21:40,780
Happy.
